    <p>
        This animation was created using Adobe Animate and features use of the software's basic functionalities, including tweening, motion guides, frame-by-frame animation, layers, symbols, and 
        the drawing tools it provides. Furthermore, this animation was imported into Adobe Premiere Pro for the sound design and the iris effect at the end.

        External sounds include the use of a copyright-free soundtrack which complements the subject's music listening experience as shown in the animation, ambient wind and fire sound effects, and the classic yell from Disney's Goofy at the end.
        Images were all drawn by hand, though took inspiration from illustrations found online.
