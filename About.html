            An avid enthusiast of digital media, net art, content creation, and programming, Sofian Mustafa is
            a third year student of Computer Science and aims to apply practices and techniques of net and
            generative art, which he will acquire knowledge of after successful completion
            of Art 321, to his future endeavours as a career programmer. Because he wishes to pursue
            the development of web applications, the skills acquired from this class will prove
            to be invaluable in areas such as ui design.

            This website provides an initial glimpse into Sofian's use of HTML and CSS, which he has recently been introduced to
            and will continue to make use of it to perfect it.
