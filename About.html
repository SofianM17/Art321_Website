            An avid enthusiast of digital media, net art, content creation, and programming, I am a third year
            student of Computer Science and aim to apply practices and techniques of net and
            generative art which I will hopefully acquire knowledge of after successful completion
            of Art 321 to my future endeavours as a career programmer. Because I wish to pursue
            the development of web applications, the skills acquired from this class will prove
            to be invaluable to me in areas such as ui design.
